# FernlitCraft License (FCL)

This repository hosts the **FernlitCraft License (FCL)** — a single, consistent license intended to cover **all FernlitCraft projects** (mods, resource packs, data packs, etc.) unless a specific project states otherwise.

- **License text:** See **[LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md)**  
- **Current version:** **FCL v1.0**

> Note: This README is a human-friendly summary. **The actual license terms are in `LICENSE.md` and control if anything conflicts.**

---

## What this license is for

FCL is designed to:
- Allow players to **use** FernlitCraft projects normally.
- Allow creators to **stream/make videos** (including monetized).
- Allow **modpack inclusion** under clear conditions.
- Prevent common abuse: **standalone reuploads, mirrors, and modified redistribution**.

---

## Quick permissions summary (plain English)

### You MAY
- Use FernlitCraft projects for personal gameplay.
- Create, upload, and monetize videos/streams featuring the projects, with proper credit + a link to the official project page.
- Include projects in modpacks **only if unmodified**, with proper credit + a link to the official project page.

### You MAY NOT
- Reupload or mirror projects as a standalone download (free or paid).
- Share modified versions (including edited audio/assets).
- Extract and redistribute assets/audio separately.
- Claim authorship or imply FernlitCraft endorsement.

Again: read **[LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md)** for the exact wording.

## For FernlitCraft (how to apply this license to a project)

Use this repo as the canonical license URL for **every** project.

### GitHub / source repo
1. Add a `LICENSE` file to the project:
   - Either copy the full text from `LICENSE.md`, **or**
   - Use a short stub that links here (recommended for easy updates):
     ```text
     Licensed under the FernlitCraft License (FCL) v1.0:
     https://RAW-LINK-TO-THIS-REPO-LICENSE.md
     ```
2. Add a “License” section to your project README that links to the official Modrinth page and to this license.

### Modrinth (per-project setting)
1. Set **License** to **Custom**
2. Set **License URL** to the raw link of `LICENSE.md` in this repo:
   - `https://RAW-LINK-TO-THIS-REPO-LICENSE.md`

---

## For modpack authors (how to comply)

If you want to include a FernlitCraft project in your modpack:

1. **Do not modify** the project file(s).
2. **Credit FernlitCraft** in the modpack description/readme.
3. **Link to the official project page**, for example:
   - Modrinth project URL: `https://modrinth.com/project/PROJECT-SLUG`

Standalone reuploads of the project (separate from your modpack) are not permitted.

---

## Versioning & changes

- FCL versions are numbered (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0, etc.).
- **Minor updates** (v1.1) clarify language without changing intent.
- **Major updates** (v2.0) may change permissions and restrictions.

This repo keeps the latest license in `LICENSE.md`. If a project specifically pins an older version, it should say so in that project’s README.

---

## Questions / requests

- If you’re unsure whether something is allowed, open an **Issue** in this repo with a short description.
- If you need special permission (e.g., localization bundles, curated packs, partnered distributions), ask first.
